# Video Super Resolution

This is a project to achieve Video Super Resolution. 
This is done as part of Seasons Of Code 2022.

Final project repo link : https://github.com/AWorldOfChaos/Super-Resolution/tree/main/Govind

This repo contains the weekly report.
I have also added some of my assignments that i worked on during the course of this project

### Week 1

We started by learning python and getting familiar with git/github.

### Week 2

Started ML course on Coursea by Andrew NG and completed 4 weeks of it. I learnt the basics Of Machine Learning. 

### Week 3

Started learning pytorch and using it for deep learning applications.
Got familiar with neural networks and how to implement them using pytorch.

### Week 4 

Started implementing my own fully-connected neural nets

### Week 5

Started implementing convoluted neural networks

### Week 6

Learn basic image processing and read up on how to implement image sr

### Week 7

Implement Image Super Resolution "9-3-5" SRCNN model

### Week 8

Extend the Image Super Resolutio to the "Naive Video Super Resolution", i.e., applying the imageSR model on individual frames of the video to get a higher resolution video

### Week 9

Documenting the results and cleaning the code and making it more user-interactive
